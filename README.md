Chile's CORFO (National Development Corporation) had been since the late 1930s responsible for a strategic State owned industry, controlling among others the oil, electricity, steel, and forestry industries. In 1970, the new government wanted to add to these industries medium sized enterprises; those producing electro-domestics, electronic products, furniture and so forth. These were strategic industries in the sense of offering a significant leverage to transform consumption patterns in the country. People at CORFO were grappling with this issue before Beer’s arrival to Chile. At his arrival, in November 1971, Beer proposed focusing on the cybernetics of the industrial economy, that is, on the communications and regulation of this exceedingly complex system. He had articulated this cybernetics in Decision and Control (Beer, 1966), the book that introduced several of us into his work in the late 1960s. This time, additionally, he had with him the manuscript of his yet unpublished book Brain of the Firm, the first of a trilogy about the Viable System Model; soon the project’s core group, about a dozen of us, was immersed in it.

During the two weeks of Beer’s first visit he managed to set up the Cybersyn project with a clear sense of urgency; supported by our briefings he produced several documents during those days. Perhaps a salient demonstration of his sense of purpose was encapsulated in a Plan of Action (Figure 1), in which he proposed precise tasks to braid organizational, informational and communication activities into a program for the management of the country’s industrial economy, which he named Cyberstride. In this Plan he also identifies specialized teams in Santiago (Team A) and in London (Team B). That Plan of Action was the beginning of the Project Cybersyn. The project lasted until September 11th 1973, when Salvador Allende’s government was overthrown by a military coup d’état.  Since then Cybersyn has received varied attention in the press and other media, not always positive, among other reasons, because of its submission to the restricted knowledge generation capabilities of the computers of those days, its unwarranted technical claims, and even for its Orwellian overtones.
